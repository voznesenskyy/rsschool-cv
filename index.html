                        <h1>About me</h1>
                        <p><strong>In 2024, I am 18 years old, and I'm just starting the path of IT.</strong><br>
                            At this time, I am a student of an actors class of college of culture, on his summer break; proud older brother, creative, versatile person.<br>
                            I see IT as an opportunity to learn something new, something special. To dive into a sphere I was always interested in, but surrounded in mystery.<br>
                            I sometimes encountered GitHub in my life, and it always looked sophisticated and challenging. I didn't understand what all of the functions were for, the links, the source code, wondered what the hell is a compiler, so I'm very glad that I'm starting to understand something. <br>
                            I have no prior coding experience, and I'm so willing to earn it here, in <br>RS School.</p>

People in the group are, to put it softly, very different, and in the beginning you really had to find an approach to each and every one, since in the end, you have to work with every one of them, whether you like it or not.</li>
