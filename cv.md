## About me

**In 2024, I am 18 years old, and I'm just starting the path of IT.**   
At this time, I am a student of an actors class of college of culture, on his summer break; proud older brother, creative, versatile person.    
I see IT as an opportunity to learn something new, something special. To dive into a sphere I was always interested in, but surrounded in mystery.  
I sometimes encountered GitHub in my life, and it always looked sophisticated and challenging. I didn't understand what all of the functions were for, the links, the source code, wondered what the hell is a compiler, so I'm very glad that I'm starting to understand something.    
I have no prior coding experience, and I'm so willing to earn it here, in RS School.    

### Incomplete list of my softskills:
* High learning ability
* Ability to communicate with people of various tempers
    * *College taught me this. You can't study for an actor, if your group isn't a team. People in the group are, to put it softly, very different, and in the beginning you really had to find an approach to each and every one, since in the end, you have to work with every one of them, whether you like it or not.*
* Desire for learning new things
* Ability to work out a desire to work tirelessly
* Ability to analyze errors and the path completed up to the current moment
* Rapid information search and usage
* Multitasking
* Time-management
* Openness and sraightness of character

**Different pastime hobbies also have their impact on my skills.**  
I am a street musician with some experience. I do photography and can draw.     
Even though college takes most of my time, since even in college-free time I have to do self-educaion - read plays, research authors and heroes, etc., I still find a spare minute for my hobbies.  

### Incomplete list of my hardskills:
* Basic Git and Markdown
* Scratch scripts
    * *A skill from a programming school I attended when I was 13. It might not be very relevant, but memory still holds.*
* Photoshop
* Photo editing
* Video montage (Sony VEGAS)
* Text writing and editing in Word in a corresponding format
* Powerpoint
* Good knowledge of the OS Windows file system
